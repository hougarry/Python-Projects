this Python exercise is designed to teach various basic concepts like constants, functions, and calculations. It's focused around preparing a lasagna and how to compute different time metrics involved in that. Let's break it down step-by-step for a beginner:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The exercise consists of three main tasks:
1. Calculate remaining bake time.
2. Calculate preparation time.
3. Calculate total elapsed time (preparation + bake time).

### Step 2: Constants
Constants are variables whose values are fixed and unchangeable throughout the program. The exercise defines two constants: `EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME` and `PREPARATION_TIME`.

```python
EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME = 40
PREPARATION_TIME = 2
```

### Step 3: First Function: bake_time_remaining
This function takes the elapsed bake time as an argument and returns the remaining time needed for baking.

```python
def bake_time_remaining(elapsed_bake_time):
    return max(0, EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME - elapsed_bake_time)
```

### Step 4: Second Function: preparation_time_in_minutes
This function calculates the preparation time based on the number of layers. It uses the constant `PREPARATION_TIME`.
#TODO: Define the 'preparation_time_in_minutes()' function below.
You might also consider using 'PREPARATION_TIME' here, if you have it defined.
def preparation_time_in_minutes(layers):
    """Calculate the total preparation time.

    :param layers: int - number of layers in the lasagna.
    :return: int - total preparation time (in minutes) based on 'PREPARATION_TIME'.
    
    Function that calculates the total preparation time for making a lasagna
    based on the number of layers. It multiplies the number of layers by the
    `PREPARATION_TIME` constant.
    """
    return layers * PREPARATION_TIME
```python
def preparation_time_in_minutes(layers):
    return layers * PREPARATION_TIME
```

### Step 5: Third Function: elapsed_time_in_minutes
This function calculates the total time elapsed, including preparation and the baking time.

```python
def elapsed_time_in_minutes(number_of_layers, elapsed_bake_time):
    preparation_time = preparation_time_in_minutes(number_of_layers)
    return preparation_time + elapsed_bake_time
```

### Step 6: Testing
Make sure to run a few tests to confirm that your functions work as expected. Here are some simple test cases:

```python
# Test for bake_time_remaining
assert bake_time_remaining(10) == 30

# Test for preparation_time_in_minutes
assert preparation_time_in_minutes(5) == 10

# Test for elapsed_time_in_minutes
assert elapsed_time_in_minutes(5, 30) == 40
```

Run these tests, and if they pass without any assertion errors, congratulations, you have successfully completed the exercise!
